      "2. Leaves: They enjoy munching on leaves from trees, shrubs, and bushes, like willow, cottonwood, and alder.\n",
      "3. Plants: Llamas eat a variety of plants, such as clover, alfalfa, and other legumes.\n",
      "4. Fruits and veggies: In the wild or in captivity, llamas might also eat fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, and sweet potatoes.\n",
      "5. Hay: A staple in many llama diets is hay, which can be timothy grass, alfalfa, or a combination of both.\n",

      "Unfortunately, there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding mental health that can perpetuate stigma, delay help-seeking, or hinder effective treatment. Here are some common myths about mental health:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Myth:** Mental illness is a personal weakness or flaw.\n",
      "**Reality:** Mental illnesses are medical conditions that affect the brain and can be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Myth:** Only crazy people get mentally ill.\n",
      "**Reality:** Mental illnesses can affect anyone, regardless of their background, education level, or occupation. They are more common than you think!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Myth:** Therapy is for \"losers\" who can't cope with life.\n",
      "**Reality:** Therapy (counseling) is a valuable tool for personal growth, stress management, and overcoming challenges. Many people seek therapy to improve their mental well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Myth:** You just need to \"toughen up\" or \"snap out of it\" if you're feeling down.\n",
      "**Reality:** Mental health issues like depression can't be overcome by willpower alone. Treatment is often necessary to effectively manage symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Myth:** People with mental illnesses are violent or dangerous.\n",
      "**Reality:** Most people with mental illnesses are not violent and are just as likely to harm themselves as anyone else. Stigma surrounding mental illness can lead to violence, not the condition itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Myth:** Mental health issues only affect adults; children are immune.\n",
      "**Reality:** Children's mental health is just as important as their physical health. Childhood trauma, bullying, and other factors can contribute to mental health issues like anxiety or depression in kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Myth:** Medications like antidepressants are addictive or ineffective.\n",
      "**Reality:** Antidepressant medications have been shown to be effective in treating depression and anxiety disorders. While they may have side effects, addiction is rare and treatment options should not be limited by fear of addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Myth:** You can \"pray away\" mental illness.\n",
      "**Reality:** Mental health issues are complex conditions that require professional treatment and support. Faith and spirituality can complement treatment, but they are no substitute for evidence-based care.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Myth:** People with mental illnesses are unable to function in society.\n",
      "**Reality:** Many people with mental illnesses lead fulfilling lives, work, and contribute to their communities. With appropriate treatment and support, individuals can thrive despite their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Myth:** Mental health issues only affect women; men don't get mentally ill.\n",
      "**Reality:** Men are just as likely to experience mental health issues like depression or anxiety disorders, but they may be less likely to seek help due to stigma and societal expectations of masculinity.\n",
